# Zomato-Data-Analysis
As a budding data analyst, I'm always looking for ways to hone my skills and explore new datasets ğŸ“‘. Recently, I've been working on a project analyzing restaurant data from Zomato, a popular restaurant finder app.

This Power BI dashboard ğŸ“Š visualizes some interesting insights ğŸ“ˆ, including:

ğŸ’¡ The distribution of restaurants across different countries.
ğŸ’¡ The breakdown of Zomato restaurants by cuisine.
ğŸ’¡ Which cities have the most restaurants on Zomato?
ğŸ’¡ The average cost for two at the most expensive restaurants.
ğŸ’¡ How many restaurants fall into each customer rating category?
